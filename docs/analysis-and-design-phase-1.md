# ANALYSIS & DESIGN
Phase 0.2: Roughly, dump model to something simulatable via an external tool, probably device_kit.

Phase 1 - Planning: Outstanding features:

  - More than one bus!
  - Data - profiles and meter data reader / analyzer / profile generator.
  - Linking data and devices i.e.  using data profiles for bounds and other things. i.e. as parameter values.
  - Sharing devices / data, crowd sourcing, searchable.
  - Running simulations in place.
  - TDevice.

I really want to validate entire use of this thing by proving out some workflow from using the tool to actually running a sim. Really need TDevice for completeness, and to support multiple busses.
